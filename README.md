# Team Member Allocation App
This is a web-based application that allows you to easily allocate team members to different teams. It is built entirely in JavaScript using the React framework.

The main features of this app are:

* **Dropdown to Select Teams:** Users can choose the team they want to work with from a dropdown menu. The app will display the team members assigned to that team.

* **Team Member Cards:** Each team member is represented by a card that displays their name and other details. Users can drag and drop these cards to reassign team members to different teams.

* **Team Member Count:** Clicking on a team name displays the number of members in that team.

* **Grouped Members:** On the teams page, members are grouped according to their team.
